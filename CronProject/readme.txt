Follwoing Approach has been used:
>>created 5 packages
>>one package for creating the jobs
>>second package for reading all the data from text files and saving it to appropriate data structure.
>>third package to schedule tasks
>>fourth package to prohibit access to some of the enlisted files
>>fifth package to control the flow.

Data structure that has been used is TreeMap because it basically stores data in sorted order.
and gives us a key map paring storage of data.

For prohibiting access, lock on files has been done.
